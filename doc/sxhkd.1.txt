sxhkd - Simple X HotKey Daemon

Synopsis
--------

*sxhkd* [_OPTIONS_] [_EXTRA_CONFIG_ …]

Description
-----------

sxhkd is a simple X hotkey daemon with a powerful and compact configuration syntax.

Options
-------


*-h*::
    Print the synopsis to standard output and exit.

*-v*::
    Print the version information to standard output and exit.

*-t* _TIMEOUT_::
    Timeout in seconds for the recording of chord chains.

*-c* _CONFIG_FILE_::
    Read the main configuration from the given file.

*-r* _REDIR_FILE_::
    Redirect the commands output to the given file.

*-s* _STATUS_FIFO_::
    Output status information to the given FIFO.

Configuration
-------------

Each line of the configuration file is interpreted as so:

* If it is empty or starts with `#`, it is ignored.
* If it starts with a space, it is read as a command.
* Otherwise, it is read as a hotkey.

General syntax:

----
HOTKEY
    COMMAND

HOTKEY     := CHORD_1 ; CHORD_2 ; … ; CHORD_n
CHORD_i    := [MODIFIER_i][@|!|~]KEYSYM_i
MODIFIER_i := MODIFIER_i1 + MODIFIER_i2 + … + MODIFIER_ik
----

The valid modifier names are: _super_, _hyper_, _meta_, _alt_, _control_, _ctrl_, _shift_, _mode_switch_, _lock_, _mod1_, _mod2_, _mod3_, _mod4_ and _mod5_.

The keysym names are given by the output of *xev*.

Hotkeys and commands can be spread across multiple lines by ending each partial line with a backslash character.

When multiple chords are separated by semicolons, the hotkey is a chord chain: the command will only be executed after receiving each chord of the chain in consecutive order.

The colon character can be used instead of the semicolon to indicate that the chord chain shall not be aborted when the chain tail is reached. In which case, the _Escape_ key can be used to manually abort the chain.

If *@* is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run on key release events, otherwise on key press events.

If *!* is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run on motion notify events and must contain two integer conversion specifications which will be replaced by the _x_ and _y_ coordinates of the pointer relative to the root window referential (the only valid button keysyms for this type of hotkeys are: _button1_, …, _button5_).

If *~* is added at the beginning of the keysym, the captured event will be replayed for the other clients.

Mouse hotkeys can be defined by using one of the following special keysym names: _button1_, _button2_, _button3_, …, _button24_.

The hotkey and the command may contain sequences of the form '{STRING_1,…,STRING_N}'.

In addition, the sequences can contain ranges of the form _A_-_Z_ where _A_ and _Z_ are alphanumeric characters.

The underscore character represents an empty sequence element.

What is actually executed is *SHELL* _-c_ *COMMAND*, which means you can use environment variables in *COMMAND*.

*SHELL* will be the content of the first defined environment variable in the following list: *SXHKD_SHELL*, *SHELL*.

If *sxhkd* receives a _SIGUSR1_ signal, it will reload its configuration file.

If no configuration file is specified via the _-c_ option, the following is used: *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxhkd/sxhkdrc*.
